My Dearest Mummy,

From the very beginning of my life, you have been my safe place, my comfort, and my greatest blessing. Before I understood the world, I understood your love. It was in the way you held me, the way you prayed for me, the way you sacrificed quietly without ever asking for recognition.

You are the definition of strength wrapped in softness. The way you love is intentional, patient, and full of grace. You have taught me kindness without preaching it, resilience without forcing it, and faith without fear.

Every achievement I celebrate has your fingerprints on it. Every step forward I take is built on the foundation you laid with your prayers, your discipline, and your unwavering belief in me. Even on the days I didn’t believe in myself, you never stopped believing in me.

Your love is the kind that protects, corrects, supports, and still forgives. The kind that stays. The kind that never runs out.

If I become even half the person you are, I will consider my life a success.

Today isn’t just about Valentine’s Day. It’s about celebrating the most constant love I have ever known — yours.

Thank you for being my home.
Thank you for being my heart.
Thank you for being my Ify.

I love you more than words can say 💗

Forever your child. 💕</h1>
